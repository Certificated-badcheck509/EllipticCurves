# Installation
C# interface  
```c#
using EllipticCurves;
```
To get started with **EllipticCurves**, it is recommended to look at the folder with [example project](examples).  
Here are results for the input [elliptic curve](https://github.com/asiryan/Cuboid_Conjecture_1): y^2 = x^3 - 17x^2 + 72x.
```
E: y^2 = x^3 - 17*x^2 + 72*x
Short Weierstrass: y^2 = x^3 - 73/3*x + 1190/27
Torsion: Z/2Z x Z/4Z
b2 = -68
b4 = 144
b6 = 0
b8 = -5184
D  = 82944
c4 = 1168
c6 = -38080
j  = 1556068/81
Torsion points:
O
(0, 0)
(8, 0)
(9, 0)
(6, 6)
(6, -6)
(12, 12)
(12, -12)
